                <li><h3>Eyeball</h3>
                <p><strong>When you size up a person or situation</strong> roll +skill. On 10+, hold 2; 
                on 7-9, hold 1. Spend a hold, now or later, to ask a question. Take 
                +1 forward when you act on the answers; give +1 forward to another 
                and share in the outcome if you prefer. Ask:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How can I help her?</li>
                    <li>What does he want?</li>
                    <li>What am I overlooking?</li>
                    <li>How can I get…</li>
                </ul>
                <p>On a miss, the GM might offer a straight-up lie, honest mistake, or tragic misunderstanding.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h3>Act Up</h3>
                <p><strong>When you try to get your way…</strong></p>
                <ul><li>…by acting like a hooligan, roll +luck.</li>
                    <li>…by acting like a lady, roll +guts.</li>
                    <li>…by acting like a natural-born Soviet airwoman, roll +medals.</li></ul>
                <p>On 10+, choose two. On 7-9, choose one:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make someone do what you want (If the person you are imposing on is a PC, she can do it or not, but if she doesn’t you are both marked)</li>
                    <li>Ensure that there are no consequences for acting up</li>
                    <li>Add one to the mission pool</li>
                </ul>
                <p>On a miss there will be trouble.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h3>Reach Out</h3>
                <p><strong>When you reach out</strong>
                to someone by letter or in person, reveal a significant new truth and roll the 
                dice. On 10+ choose 2. On 7-9 choose one:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Remove one harm each from you and your friend</li>
                    <li>Change the target and/or tone of a currently filled Regard slot</li>
                    <li>Add one to the mission pool</li>
                </ul>
                <p>On a miss your efforts are inneffective, misunderstood or understood all too 
                clearly.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h3>Scrounge</h3>
                <p><strong>Whenever some specific thing is desperately needed,</strong> roll straight if going 
                through channels, or roll +luck if you aren’t so good with paperwork. On a you 
                get what you need and add one to the mission pool. On a 7-9 you get what you 
                need but choose two (<em>Misanthropes choose one</em>):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You attract unwanted attention</li>
                    <li>You take 1-harm from lack of sleep</li>
                    <li>You get poor quality stuff</li>
                    <li>You incur a debt
                </ul>
                <p>On a miss it can’t be acquired for love or money. Well, for money, anyway. The 
                GM might choose three options from the 7-9 list or worse.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h3>Repair</h3>
                <p>If a plane has been torn up or broken down <strong>and you help the mechanics fix 
                    her</strong>, roll +skill.</p>
                <p>On any hit you patch it together and it is no longer damaged. On 7-9 you 
                patch it together but choose two (<em>Protectors choose one</em>):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>She’ll fly eventually, but not tonight</li>
                    <li>You take 1-harm from lack of sleep</li>
                    <li>You don’t complete the job in the officially approved manner</li>
                    <li>The plane acquires a personality if it doesn’t have one already</li>
                </ul>
                <p>On a miss you are sending it into combat still damaged. Maybe that’s obvious 
                and maybe it isn’t.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h3>Tempt Fate</h3>
                <p><strong>When you tempt fate</strong> roll +guts. On a 10+ you do it. On a 7-9 you do it but 
                not without cost - The GM can offer you a worse outcome, a hard bargain, or 
                an ugly choice.</p>
                <p>On a miss you take harm as established and are marked in addition to failing. Fate is a suka.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h3>Briefing (Ranking Officer)</h3>
                <p><strong>When the sun begins to set, consult with the GM and inform your 
                    aircrews about the coming night’s objective.</strong> Assign a navigator to Wayfind and a pilot to lead the Attack Run. The remaining player characters are 
                Vedomaya; assign each to cover another plane. Choose and check off a mission 
                from the Duty Station sheet and present it to the assembled regiment. Don’t 
                forget to announce any medals and promotions during the briefing.</p></li>
                <li data-role="list-divider">Night Moves</li>
                <li>
                <h3>Vedomaya</h3>
                <p>When you cover your assigned fellow plane during a mission, hold 1. 
                Spend your hold at any time to take one of their consequences on yourself or 
                your aircraft.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h3>Wayfind (Navigator)</h3>
                <p><strong>When you lead a flight to a target...</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>...by daylight, or to your airbase at any time, you find it. </li>
                    <li>...at night, roll +skill. On a 10+ you find it and line up a textbook approach. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>On a 7-9 you find it and choose one consequence:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your plane suffers a minor mechanical failure (plane is damaged)</li>
                    <li>They are waiting for you (triggers Enemy Fire)</li>
                    <li>You’re stressed or banged around (split 2 harm however you want)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>On a miss either scrub the mission and return in shame, or strike the target 
                late and alone, forcing you to make your own Attack Run. Planes relying on 
                your navigation can choose which miss condition they would prefer.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h3>Attack Run (Pilot)</h3>
                <p><strong>When you lead an attack on a target,</strong> roll +guts. On a 10+ your payload connects! Choose one. On a 7-9, it’s a hit and choose two consequences:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The damage to the target is not significant and it is your fault</li>
                    <li>You fly through a storm of flak (triggers Enemy Fire)</li>
                    <li>A plane in your Section is damaged, GM’s choice</li>
                    <li>You and your fellow airwoman are marked</li>
                </ul>
                <p>On a miss either abort the attack completely, which will surely trigger an Informal Interview back at base or desperately press on, Tempting Fate. Planes relying on your leadership can choose which miss condition they would prefer.</p>
                <p>After an Attack Run by a Leader, if other pilots decide to make an additional Attack Run they enjoy +1 forward.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h3>Tempt Fate</h3>
                <p><strong>When you tempt fate</strong> roll +guts. On a 10+ you do it. On a 7-9 you do it but 
                not without cost - The GM can offer you a worse outcome, a hard bargain, or 
                an ugly choice.</p>
                <p>On a miss you take harm as established and are marked in addition to failing. Fate is a suka.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h3>Enemy Fire</h3>
                <p><strong>When your Po-2 is hit by bullets or flak</strong> roll +luck. On a 10+ the old girl’s in one piece and you are fine. On a 7-9 she holds together and you choose two consequences:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You and your fellow airwoman are marked</li>
                    <li>Casualties on board (Split 5 harm between you however you like; also triggers Wheels Down later)</li>
                    <li>Your plane is damaged (Also triggers Wheels Down later)</li>
                    <li>Another plane in your section goes down (GM will decide which)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>On a miss the GM might choose three from the 7-9 list or maybe something more horrific.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h3>Wheels Down</h3>
                <p><strong>When you land a plane under less than ideal circumstances</strong> roll +skill. 
                “Less than ideal” includes putting it down anywhere but a prepared airfield, 
                or with battle damage, or with injured or dead crew. On a 10+ you and your 
                Po-2 are on the ground and in one piece. Change an open Regard slot to refer 
                to your plane if you want.</p>
                <p>On 7-9 you prang the plane; and choose two consequences (<em>Adventurers 
                    choose one</em>):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It’s unflyable (plane is damaged; if already damaged it is a fiery wreck)</li>
                    <li>Casualties on board (Split 3 harm between you however you like)</li>
                    <li>Your lack of skill, courage or care with the people’s machinery is noted</li>
                    <li>Your landing puts you in immediate danger.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>On a miss the GM will start with a fiery wreck and build from there.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <h3>Debrief</h3>
                <p><strong>When you debrief after a mission</strong>, tell your Chief of Staff or Squadron Commander what went right and what went wrong. The GM may inflict stress harm as established. If you wish, change the tone of any existing Regard. If you are a <em>Zealot</em>, publicly shame a comrade and add one to the next night’s mission pool if you wish. If it was the duty station’s last mission, begin Operational Planning.</p>
                </li>
                <li data-role="list-divider">Special Moves</li>
                <li><h3>Operational Planning</h3>
                <p><strong>When all missions have been completed</strong>, the Regiment’s time at the current airbase is over. Fast-forward your story and change Duty Stations. This is a good time to consider changing GMs as well. </p>
                <p>This move has the following additional effects: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Everyone heals and all planes are resupplied and repaired. </li>
                    <li>Anyone who fulfilled their Role condition advances. </li>
                    <li>Anyone can change their Role if they wish. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Orient everyone to the new Duty Station before continuing.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h3>Informal Interview</h3>
                <p><strong>When you are questioned by the NKVD</strong>, roll +luck if you lie and +guts if you tell the truth (<em>Dreamers</em> can roll using whatever stat they prefer). On a 10+, they thank you for your time. On a 7-9, also choose one:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You incriminate a family member or a comrade you have positive Regard for (you choose).</li>
                    <li>You agree to frame the target of their current investigation (GM chooses).</li>
                    <li>You and the comrade of your choice are Marked.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>On a miss, the People’s Commissariat for Internal Affairs takes an interest in you.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h3>Behind Enemy Lines</h3>
                <p><strong>When you find yourself on foot behind enemy lines</strong>, you are Marked. The GM will present you with your immediate circumstances.</p>
                <p>You have a pistol, some high-energy milk sweets, and a map and compass. Everyone evading capture rolls for themselves.</p>
                <p>If you have landed in an active combat zone, roll +guts.</p>
                <p>If you find yourself in lonely terrain far from the front lines, roll +skill.</p>
                <p>If you’ve put down in or near a village or farm, roll +luck.</p>
                <p>On 10+, you’ll return to the Regiment unharmed and ready for duty. Who aided you? On 7-9, choose two:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Return after some time in hiding. Where did you hide?</li>
                    <li>Return unfit for duty. How were you hurt? (Take Harm as established.)</li>
                    <li>Return under a cloud of suspicion. What arouses the Politruk’s suspicion? (Expect an Informal Interview.)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>On a miss, you don’t evade capture.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h3>Coming Home</h3>
                <p>When you return to the 588th…</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>…AFTER A MISSION, give thanks for your survival and Debrief. </li>
                    <li>…AFTER A LENGTHY ABSENCE DUE TO INJURY, all Harm is removed and you are pronounced fit for duty. Effects of your war injuries may linger.</li>
                    <li>…AFTER A LENGTHY ABSENCE DUE TO ARREST, retain Harm as established. Time in NKVD interrogation facilities and prisons is not healthy.</li>
                    <li>…AFTER A LENGTHY ABSENCE DUE TO SOME DISASTER, like a crash behind enemy lines, retain harm as established. An injured, exhausted airwoman who drags herself home may be headed straight for the hospital. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Regardless of the nature of the absence, ask some questions. Where was she? What did she see and do that contrasts sharply with life in the Regiment? How has she changed?</p>
                </li>
                <li><h3>Severe Injury</h3>
                <p>When you are badly wounded, describe the nature and extent of your injuries and go straight to the hospital or assume temporary duty as a staff officer. Serious injury requires medical care and you will be grounded while you recover. Consider assuming GM duties while the former GM’s character takes the place of yours on combat missions.</p>
                <p>When you have recovered, choose one:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Accept a medical discharge and retire from active service honorably.</li>
                    <li>Return to duty. The Regimental Politruk will vet you for loyalty and commitment and the Chief of Staff will assign you as needed.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
